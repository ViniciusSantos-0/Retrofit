# Retrofit

Applying concepts for running an API with the Retrofit2 library. 

API used in this project: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

If you get this error:
"Connection to target VM, address: 'localhost:(number)', transport: 'socket'".

Use this solution: 

in android studio: tools->android->enable adb integration(this should be checked) 
uncheck this, then check again. this solved this problem for me. (restarts adb integration)
